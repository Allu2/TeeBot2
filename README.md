#TeeBot2#

TeeBot2 is a rewrite of my old TeeBot server monitoring bot.

Features I am planning to implement are:

+Killing spree messages (100% done)

+Shutdown messages (100% done) <--- will be rather quick to do though.

+Proper handling of playerlist (99.9% done)

+Support for more events (70% done)

+Support for protecting admin/mod nicks (0% done)

All percents are more or less fictional.

##Installation/Usage##

1. Download all the .py files in same directory from the git (or simply git clone)
2. Make file "config.py" and add there lines:
* password = "myrconpassword"
* hostname = "myserveripaddress or hostname"
* port = 1337 (or what ever port you use)
* banned_nicks = ["List", "Of", "Banned nick names"]
3. Run your teeworlds server
4. run python3 Bot.py

DISCLAIMER: Errors may occur, Your cat may be eaten, Your server might be compromised. Its not my fault, its yours.
