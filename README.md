#TeeBot2#

TeeBot2 is a rewrite of my old TeeBot server monitoring bot.

Features I am planning to implement are:

+Killing spree messages (100% done)

+Shutdown messages (100% done) <--- will be rather quick to do though.

+Proper handling of playerlist (99% done)

+Support for more events (60% done)


All percents are more or less fictional.

##Installation/Usage##

1. Download all the .py files in same directory from the git (or simply git clone)
2. Make file "passwordi.py" and add there line: password = "myrconpassword"
3. Change the '9001' in Bot.py line 26 to what ever port your teeworlds server uses for telnet
4. Run your teeworlds server
5. run python3 Bot.py

DECLAIMER: Errors may occur, Your cat may be eaten, Your server might be compromised. Its not my fault, its yours.
