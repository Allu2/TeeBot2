TeeBot2 is a rewrite of my old TeeBot server monitoring bot.

Features I am planning to implement are:

+Killing spree messages (95% done)

+Shutdown messages (0% done) <--- will be rather quick to do though.

+Proper handling of playerlist (??% done)

+Support for more events (40% done)


All percents are more or less fictional.
